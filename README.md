### Examples of Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions
Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
result
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
hours = 200 / 60
hours
